this is a **living document**

## philosophy

- [Feynman's Nobel Amibition](http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html)
- "[I want programming computers to be like coloring with crayons and playing with duplo blocks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4310723)"
- "[If you only do things that are certain to succeed, then you're only going to be doing very obvious things.](https://twitter.com/wjagodfrey/status/659274018478886912)"
- [In the Beginning was the Command Line](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~mwilliams/reading/misc/command.txt)
- "[When applications are done well, they are just the really application-specific, brackish residue that can't be so easily abstracted away. All the nice, reusable components sublimate away onto github and npm where everybody can collaborate to advance the commons.](http://substack.net/how_I_write_modules)"
- ["the emerging [Node] aesthetic of radical re-usability and module-driven development"](http://substack.net/node_aesthetic)
- ["If your framework melts away into an informal collection of modules that happen to work well together but can be easily repurposed by people who don't use the framework, then you have built something very sublime."](http://substack.net/many_things)
